    <h1>Other Personal Projects</h1>
    <p>I do a lot of personal projects. Somethimes I even write about them! I'm trying to do that more. Here's some of
        the write-ups I've done so far</p>

    <p style="font-size: 140%;">You should check <a href="/projects/github/">this page that lists my github projects</a> instead, it has many more projects! This page has some write-ups you won't find over there though.</p>

    <h3 id='fastbin'>RIT COVID Dashboard
        <span class="projlink"><a
                href="https://ritcoviddashboard.com">https://ritcoviddashboard.com</a></span>
    </h3>
    <p>My school, the Rochester Institute of Technology, provides no way to see historical data. I wrote a scraper in
        Python that saves data to a SQLite database, expose all the data via a JSON API, and then display it as a React app.
        You can read more about <a
            href="/projects/ritcoviddashboard">the API and dashboard here.</a></p>

    <h3 id='fastbin'>FastBin
        <!-- <span class="projlink"><a href="https://fastbin.mastrchef.rocks/">https://fastbin.mastrchef.rocks/</a></span>-->

    <p>FastBin is a quick project I wrote that provides client-side encryption for text snippets. A core idea is for
        the encryption secret to never be sent to the server. You can read <a href="/projects/fastbin">more about
            FastBin here.</a></p>

    <h3 id='spotify'>Spotify Recent Plays
        <!-- <span class="projlink"><a href="https://galenguyer.com/spotify/">https://galenguyer.com/spotify/</a></span>-->
    </h3>
    <p>A small project to display the songs I've recently listened to on Spotify. It draws directly from the
        spotify API using an ASP.NET app and displays it using a TypeScript/React app. You can read <a
            href="/projects/spotifyrecent">more about the Spotify Recent Plays app here.</a></p>
