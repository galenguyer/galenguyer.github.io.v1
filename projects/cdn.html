    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Why did I do this? Well, I read <a href="https://pasztor.at/blog/building-your-own-cdn">this article</a> and thought it looked neat. Then, a friend built one, following that blog. I had $150 per month in Azure credit from interning at Microsoft, so I decided to replicate it in Azure.</p>
    <p>This site and <a href='//cdn.galenguyer.com'>cdn.galenguyer.com</a> are both hosted on this CDN for high speed and availability.</p>
    
    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>The CDN consists of <a href='https://cdn.galenguyer.com/img/nodes.png'>seven edge nodes</a>. The Master server is located at RIT and is not reachable though the CDN. It servers as a coordinator for the edge nodes. The edge nodes are Standard B1ls Virtual Machines with 1 vCPU, 0.5GB of RAM, and 32GB of SSD storage.</p>
    <p>The scripts used for management can be located <a href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/cdn-configs'>on my git instance.</a> They are responsible for ensuring packages are installed and up to date, configurations are synced and applied, and static files are up to date on the edge servers.</p>
    <p>A <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/traffic-manager/">Traffic Manager</a> configured to route based off geographic location ensures users get the nearest server, and handles failover in the event a server goes down.</p>

    <h3>Speed</h3>
    <p>I tested the CDN with <a href="https://latency.apex.sh/?url=galenguyer.com&compare=elite.tips">apex.sh's latency tester.</a> <a href="https://elite.tips">elite.tips</a> is backed by cloudflare, and my CDN is comparable in most regions. For a system that I built for fun, I'm very happy with that.</p>
