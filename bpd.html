        <h2>Diagnostic Features</h2>
        <p>The essential feature of borderline personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of instability of
            interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity that begins by early adulthood
            and is present in a variety of contexts.</p>
        <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder make frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
            (Criterion 1). The perception of impending separation or rejection, or the loss of external structure, can
            lead to profound changes in self-image, affect, cognition, and behavior. These individuals are very
            sensitive to environmental circumstances. They ex­perience intense abandonment fears and inappropriate anger
            even when faced with a real­istic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans
            (e.g., sudden despair in reaction to a clinician's announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when
            some­one important to them is just a few minutes late or must cancel an appointment). They may believe that
            this "abandonment" implies they are "bad." These abandonment fears are re­lated to an intolerance of being
            alone and a need to have other people with them. Their frantic efforts to avoid abandonment may include
            impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or sui­cidal behaviors, which are described separately in
            Criterion 5.</p>
        <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder have a pattern of unstable and intense relationships
            (Criterion 2). They may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or second meeting, demand to
            spend a lot of time together, and share the most intimate details early in a relationship. However, they may
            switch quickly from idealizing other people to devaluing them, feeling that the other person does not care
            enough, does not give enough, or is not "there" enough. These individuals can empathize with and nurture
            other people, but only with the expectation that the other person will "be there" in return to meet their
            own needs on demand. These individuals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their view of others, who
            may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive. Such shifts often reflect
            disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had been idealized or whose rejection or
            abandonment is expected.</p>
        <p>There may be an identity disturbance characterized by markedly and persistently un­stable self-image or sense
            of self (Criterion 3). There are sudden and dramatic shifts in self-image, characterized by shifting goals,
            values, and vocational aspirations. There may be sudden changes in opinions and plans about career, sexual
            identity, values, and types of friends. These individuals may suddenly change from the role of a needy
            supplicant for help to that of a righteous avenger of past mistreatment. Although they usually have a
            self-image that is based on being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have feelings
            that they do not exist at all. Such experiences usually occur in situations in which the individual feels a
            lack of a meaningful relationship, nurturing, and support. These in­dividuals may show worse performance in
            unstructured work or school situations.</p>
        <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder display impulsivity in at least two areas that are
            potentially self-damaging (Criterion 4). They may gamble, spend money irrespon­sibly, binge eat, abuse
            substances, engage in unsafe sex, or drive recklessly. Individuals with this disorder display recurrent
            suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilat­ing behavior (Criterion 5). Completed suicide
            occurs in 8%-10% of such individuals, and self-mutilative acts (e.g., cutting or burning) and suicide
            threats and attempts are very common. Recurrent suicidality is often the reason that these individuals
            present for help. These self-destructive acts are usually precipitated by threats of separation or rejection
            or by expectations that the individual assumes increased responsibility. Self-mutilation may occur during
            dissociative experiences and often brings relief by reaffirming the ability to feel or by expiating the
            individual's sense of being evil</p>
        <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder may display affective instability that is due to a marked
            reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability, or anx­iety usually lasting a few hours
            and only rarely more than a few days) (Criterion 6). The basic dysphoric mood of those with borderline
            personality disorder is often disrupted by periods of anger, panic, or despair and is rarely relieved by
            periods of well-being or satis­faction. These episodes may reflect the individual's extreme reactivity to
            interpersonal stresses. Individuals with borderline personality disorder may be troubled by chronic
            feel­ings of emptiness (Criterion 7). Easily bored, they may constantly seek something to do. Individuals
            with this disorder frequently express inappropriate, intense anger or have dif­ficulty controlling their
            anger (Criterion 8). They may display extreme sarcasm, enduring bitterness, or verbal outbursts. The anger
            is often elicited when a caregiver or lover is seen as neglectful, withholding, uncaring, or abandoning.
            Such expressions of anger are often followed by shame and guilt and contribute to the feeling they have of
            being evil. During periods of extreme stress, transient paranoid ideation or dissociative symptoms (e.g.,
            de­personalization) may occur (Criterion 9), but these are generally of insufficient severity or duration to
            warrant an additional diagnosis. These episodes occur most frequently in re­sponse to a real or imagined
            abandonment. Symptoms tend to be transient, lasting min­utes or hours. The real or perceived return of the
            caregiver's nurturance may result in a remission of symptoms.</p>
        <h2>Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>Individuals with borderline personality disorder may have a pattern of undermining themselves at the moment a
            goal is about to be realized (e.g., dropping out of school just before graduation; regressing severely after
            a discussion of how well therapy is going; de­stroying a good relationship just when it is clear that the
            relationship could last). Some in­dividuals develop psychotic-like symptoms (e.g., hallucinations,
            body-image distortions, ideas of reference, hypnagogic phenomena) during times of stress. Individuals with
            this disorder may feel more secure with transitional objects (i.e., a pet or inanimate possession) than in
            interpersonal relationships. Premature death from suicide may occur in individu­als with this disorder,
            especially in those with co-occurring depressive disorders or sub­stance use disorders. Physical handicaps
            may result from self-inflicted abuse behaviors or failed suicide attempts. Recurrent job losses, interrupted
            education, and separation or di­vorce are common. Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, hostile conflict, and
            early parental loss are more common in the childhood histories of those with borderline personality
            dis­order. Common co-occurring disorders include depressive and bipolar disorders, sub­stance use disorders,
            eating disorders (notably bulimia nervosa), posttraumatic stress disorder, and
            attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Borderline personality disorder also frequently co-occurs with the
            other personality disorders.</p>
        <h2>Prevalence</h2>
        <p>The median population prevalence of borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 1.6% but may be as
            high as 5.9%. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder is about 6% in primary care settings, about
            10% among individuals seen in outpatient mental health clinics, and about 20% among psychiatric inpatients.
            The prevalence of borderline personality disorder may decrease in older age groups.</p>
        <h2>Development and Course</h2>
        <p>There is considerable variability in the course of borderline personality disorder. The most common pattern is
            one of chronic instability in early adulthood, with episodes of serious affective and impulsive dyscontrol
            and high levels of use of health and mental health re­sources. The impairment from the disorder and the risk
            of suicide are greatest in the young-adult years and gradually wane with advancing age. Although the
            tendency to­ward intense emotions, impulsivity, and intensity in relationships is often lifelong,
            indi­viduals who engage in therapeutic intervention often show improvement beginning sometime during the
            first year. During their 30s and 40s, the majority of individuals with this disorder attain greater
            stability in their relationships and vocational functioning. Fol­low-up studies of individuals identified
            through outpatient mental health clinics indicate that after about 10 years, as many as half of the
            individuals no longer have a pattern of be­havior that meets full criteria for borderline personality
            disorder.</p>
        <h2>Risk and Prognostic Factors</h2>
        <p><b>Genetic and physiological.</b> Borderline personality disorder is about five times more common among
            first-degree biological relatives of those with the disorder than in the gen­eral population. There is also
            an increased familial risk for substance use disorders, anti­social personality disorder, and depressive or
            bipolar disorders.</p>
        <h2>Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues</h2>
        <p>The pattern of behavior seen in borderline personality disorder has been identified in many settings around
            the world. Adolescents and young adults with identity problems (especially when accompanied by substance
            use) may transiently display behaviors that misleadingly give the impression of borderline personality
            disorder. Such situations are characterized by emotional instability, "existential" dilemmas, uncertainty,
            anxiety-provoking choices, con­flicts about sexual orientation, and competing social pressures to decide on
            careers.</p>
        <h2>Gender-Related Diagnostic issues</h2>
        <p>Borderline personality disorder is diagnosed predominantly (about 75%) in females.</p>
        <h2>Differential Diagnosis</h2>
        <p><b>Depressive and bipolar disorders.</b> Borderline personality disorder often co-occurs with depressive or
            bipolar disorders, and when criteria for both are met, both may be diagnosed. Because the cross-sectional
            presentation of borderline personality disorder can be mimicked by an episode of depressive or bipolar
            disorder, the clinician should avoid giving an addi­tional diagnosis of borderline personality disorder
            based only on cross-sectional presenta­tion without having documented that the pattern of behavior had an
            early onset and a long­standing course.</p>
        <p><b>Other personality disorders.</b> Other personality disorders may be confused with border­line personality
            disorder because they have certain features in common. It is therefore im­portant to distinguish among these
            disorders based on differences in their characteristic features. However, if an individual has personality
            features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders in addition to borderline personality
            disorder, all can be diag­nosed. Although histrionic personality disorder can also be characterized by
            attention seek­ing, manipulative behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions, borderline personality disorder is
            distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships, and chronic feelings of
            deep emptiness and loneliness. Paranoid ideas or illusions may be pres­ent in both borderline personality
            disorder and schizotypal personality disorder, but these symptoms are more transient, interpersonally
            reactive, and responsive to external structur­ing in borderline personality disorder. Although paranoid
            personality disorder and narcis­sistic personality disorder may also be characterized by an angry reaction
            to minor stimuli, the relative stability of self-image, as well as the relative lack of
            self-destructiveness, impulsivity, and abandonment concerns, distinguishes these disorders from borderline
            person­ality disorder. Although antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder are both
            characterized by manipulative behavior, individuals with antisocial personality disorder are manipulative to
            gain profit, power, or some other material gratification, whereas the goal in borderline personality
            disorder is directed more toward gaining the con­cern of caretakers. Both dependent personality disorder and
            borderline personality disorder are characterized by fear of abandonment; however, the individual with
            borderline person­ality disorder reacts to abandonment with feelings of emotional emptiness, rage, and
            de­mands, whereas the individual with dependent personality disorder reacts with increasing appeasement and
            submissiveness and urgently seeks a replacement relationship to provide caregiving and support. Borderline
            personality disorder can further be distinguished from dependent personality disorder by the typical pattern
            of unstable and intense relationships.</p>
        <p><b>Personality change due to another medical condition.</b> Borderline personality disor­der must be
            distinguished from personality change due to another medical condition, in which the traits that emerge are
            attributable to the effects of another medical condition on the central nervous system.</p>
        <p><b>Substance use disorders.</b> Borderline personality disorder must also be distinguished from symptoms that
            may develop in association with persistent substance use.</p>
        <p><b>Identity problems.</b> Borderline personality disorder should be distinguished from an identity problem,
            which is reserved for identity concerns related to a developmental phase (e.g., adolescence) and does not
            qualify as a mental disorder.</p>
