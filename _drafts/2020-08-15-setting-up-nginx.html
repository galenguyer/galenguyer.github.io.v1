<p id="intro">Setting up a website is a good first task for anyone looking to get into server administration.
    it requires a basic grasp of Linux concepts like package management, system services, and how to
    edit configuration files. This guide will walk you through installing <a href="https://nginx.org/">nginx</a> on
    Ubuntu or Fedora
    and securing it with <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a> for HTTPS.
</p>
<div id="install">
    <h3>Installing Nginx and Certbot</h3>
    <p>The first step will be installing nginx. There are several ways to go about this, so I'll run through them from
        easiest to hardest.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to install nginx will be to use the official packages. This can be done with <code>apt install
            nginx</code> on Ubuntu and Debian or <code>dnf install nginx</code> on Fedora.
        However, official repositories are normally a few versions behind. While this isn't necessarily bad, some people
        (myself included) like
        using the newest version for some features that won't be touched on in this guide.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to install the latest version of nginx will be to use packages I build and maintain. <b>However,
            this only works on Ubuntu 18+.</b> To get started, first add
        my <a href="/pubkey.txt">GPG key</a> to apt and then add the package repository I maintain to your apt sources.
        The easiest way to do this
        is to run <code>curl -sSL https://packages.galenguyer.com/bootstrap.sh | sh</code>, though if you're
        <a href="https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2016/04/detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side/">hesitant to pipe from
            curl to bash</a>, you can download
        and run the script normally. Finally, install the package you want. Five are provided, with various feature
        sets. Mainline packages are the latest version of nginx, whereas
        stable packages use the nginx stable branch, which is slightly behind mainline. Packages with "quiche" in the
        name have experimental HTTP/3 support enabled,
        which I don't reccomend unless you're familiar with nginx and ready to debug it. I would suggest installing the
        <code>edgeinx-mainline</code> package for the best mix of features and stability.
        This can be done by simply running <code>apt install edgeinx-mainline</code>. Any time you update your system
        with apt update or upgrade, it will update this package if a newer version is found as well.
    </p>
    <p>The last way to install nginx is build it from source yourself. If you want to do this, I reccomend using <a
            href="https://cdn.galenguyer.com/txt/build-nginx.sh">this script</a>,
        which was originally written by <a href="https://seedno.de">Seednode</a>. You can edit it to change the version
        of nginx you install and change what features are installed as well. It will also set up default config files
        and a systemd service for you. I last tested it on Ubuntu 18.04, but it should work on all modern versions of
        Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora.
        Be warned, it will take a long time to run if you don't have a relatively powerful CPU.</p>

    <p>The final thing you'll want to install is certbot-auto. I've found it the easiest way to interact with
        Let'sEncrypt for certificates.
        You can install it by running the following commands:
        <pre>sudo curl -sSL https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto -o /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/certbot-auto</pre>
    </p>

    <h3>Configuring Nginx for plain HTTP</h3>
    <p>Now that nginx is installed, let's complete the basic setup. Before doing this, make sure you have a domain set
        up that resolves to the public IP address of your server.
    </p>
    <p>To configure nginx, enter the <code>/etc/nginx</code> directory on your server. You'll need root permissions to
        edit or create any files here. It will be populated with a few basic config files as well as default versions
        for all of them, which you can choose to keep or remove with <code>rm *default</code></p>
    <p>First, create two directories in which to store your configuration files using the following command:</p>
    <pre># mkdir -p /etc/nginx/{sites,ssl}</pre>
    <p>Now that those directories exist, modify your <code>nginx.conf</code> file to include any configuration files we
        put in the <code>/etc/nginx/sites</code> directory. An example configuration file is available here: <a
            href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/raw/branch/master/nginx.conf'>nginx.conf</a>.</p>

    <p>Next, create the file <code>/etc/nginx/ssl/params.conf</code>, where you'll configure HTTPS. You won't use these
        yet, but we'll get back to them. An example file with comments is available here: <a
            href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/raw/branch/master/ssl/params.conf'>ssl/params.conf</a>.</p>
    <p>You'll also want to generate a dhparam.pem file. Here is a <a
            href='https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/94390/whats-the-purpose-of-dh-parameters'>good
            explanation of what they're used for,</a> though understanding that isn't required. Use the following
        command to generate the file:</p>
    <pre># touch /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem && openssl dhparam --out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 4096</pre>

    <p>Now that your basic HTTPS configuration is done, let's tell nginx to listen for requests over HTTP for your
        website and serve files. This will also let us set up HTTPS.</p>
    <p>In the <code>/etc/nginx/sites</code> directory, create a file ending with <code>.conf</code>. The actual name
        isn't important, but I find it useful to follow the pattern of <code>[domain].conf</code>, so I know which file
        controls which site. An example plain HTTP configuration file can be found here: <a
            href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/raw/branch/master/sites/example.com.nohttps.conf'>sites/example.com.nohttps.conf</a>,
        but you won't need more than the following four lines. Whichever configuration you go with, make sure to update
        the <code>server_name</code> and <code>root</code> options.
        <pre><b># /etc/nginx/sites/example.com.conf</b>

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com;
}</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Now that all your configuration files are in place, run <code>sudo nginx -t</code> to test your configuration. If
        there are any errors, it will tell you, otherwise, you're good to apply the configuration! To do that, simply
        run <code>sudo systemctl restart nginx</code>, and you should be able to navigate to your website and see any
        pages you have!</p>
</div>
<div id='https'>
    <h3>Setting up HTTPS with LetsEncrypt</h3>
    <p>Now that you can access your website, it's time to get a certificate for HTTPS. Use the following command, making
        sure to update the -w and -d options appropriately:
        <pre># certbot-auto certonly --webroot -w /var/www/example.com/ -d example.com -d www.example.com --rsa-key-size 4096</pre>
    </p>
    <p>Once this completes, you will have the certificates in <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com</code>.
        You'll have to renew them using the same command or <code>certbot-auto renew</code> every 90 days.</p>
    <p>Finally, modify your configuration to use the certificate you just generated. You can use the example file at the
        following link, making sure to change from example.com to your domain! <a
            href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/raw/branch/master/sites/example.com.conf'>sites/example.com.conf</a>
    </p>
    <p>Once you've modified the configuration file, test it with <code>sudo nginx -t</code> again, and if everything is
        good, apply it with <code>sudo systemctl reload nginx</code>. Now, when you visit your site, it should redirect
        you to the HTTPS version. Just repeat this process to add any more domains!</p>

    <h3>A couple notes</h3>
    <p>All example configuration files can be found at <a
            href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/'>https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/</a></p>
    <p>You might have noticed some blocks for php in the example config files. If you want to use PHP, install it (the
        command for Ubuntu is <code>sudo apt install php7.2-fpm</code>) and uncomment the lines as shown in <a
            href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/raw/branch/master/sites/example.com.withphp.conf'>this
            config file.</a> You may need to change the socket path. If you are missing any of the other php config
        files, you can find in <a href='https://git.galenguyer.com/chef/nginx-demo/'>this git repo.</a></p>
